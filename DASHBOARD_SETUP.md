# Dashboard Setup

## Starting the Server

```bash
# Double-click or run from terminal:
serve_dashboard.bat

# Or manually:
python -m http.server 8080
```

The server must run from the project root (`C:\BlueprintLLM`) so relative paths to `logs/` resolve correctly.

## Dashboard URLs

| Dashboard | URL | Description |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| Live Monitor | `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/live.html` | Real-time pipeline progress with hierarchical timeline, training metrics, and loss chart. Polls `logs/pipeline_live_state.json` every 3s. |
| Training Dashboard | `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/index.html` | Static overview of training history, node mastery, exam results, health alerts. Regenerated by `14_update_dashboard.py`. |
| Pipeline Flowchart | `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/flowchart.html` | SVG flowchart of the 9-step pipeline hierarchy with phase color coding. |

## What Each Dashboard Shows

### Live Monitor (`live.html`)
- **Status pill**: running / idle / disconnected
- **Clocks**: start time, elapsed, ETA remaining
- **Current step**: step ID, description, progress bar
- **Hierarchical timeline**: 9 major phases, active phase expanded with substeps, completed phases collapsed
- **Training metrics**: loss + learning rate during steps 3.x/4.x, SVG loss chart

### Training Dashboard (`index.html`)
- Loss curve across training epochs
- Node mastery heatmap (41 node types)
- Lesson tracking table
- Health alerts panel
- Activity log

### Pipeline Flowchart (`flowchart.html`)
- 9 phases as colored blocks: Data (blue), Training (amber), Evaluation (green), Integration (violet)
- Arrows showing pipeline flow
- Feedback loop from Lesson Integration back to Data Foundation

## Troubleshooting

- **CORS / file:// issues**: The live dashboard fetches JSON via `fetch()`, which fails with `file://` URLs. Always use the HTTP server.
- **"disconnected" status**: The live monitor can't reach `logs/pipeline_live_state.json`. Ensure the HTTP server is running from the project root.
- **Stale data**: The live monitor polls every 3 seconds. If the pipeline isn't running, you'll see the idle overlay with the last run's completed steps.
- **Training metrics not showing**: The metrics panel only appears during steps 3.x and 4.x (model setup + training). It hides otherwise.
